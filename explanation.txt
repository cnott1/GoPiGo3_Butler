command_gold determines how much distance there is until the next waypoint.

dvc_drive_rerouting tracks how much distance has been covered, and will loop until reaching destination.

dvc_drive_in_breakable works as drive_in, but can interrupt when the sensor detects a wall. it returns how much distance was successfully covered for Rerouting to track.

when hitting an obstacle, the Rerouter function will see if there is at least 15 inches remaining before the next waypoint to actually execute the manuever.

if so, wait a few seconds then try and do a manuever. If successful, subtract 15 inches from the remaining leg's distance. Otherwise, just wait in place until the object moves.

once the waypoint is reached, we go back into our command_gold and use normal gopigo turning before repeating the cycle for the next waypoint.
